            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Pranav S </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Bangalore, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.
            <br />
            I have successfully completed an internship at ISRO’s Master Control Facility (MCF),<br />
            where I worked on a full-stack web development project.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>

            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Games

            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Travelling
            </li>
          </ul>
